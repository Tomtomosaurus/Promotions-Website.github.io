            From when I was very little, I had a passion for PCs, or more accurately, PC video games.
            <br><br>
            This was fueled by my obsessive watching of YouTubers who played these various games, such as Kwebblekop, Jelly, Slogoman, Ssundee, DanTDM, Mumbo Jumbo, McCreamy and Lazarbeam.
            <br><br>
            As you may probably have noticed, these were primarily Minecraft and Fortnite YouTubers (yes, I was that type of kid)
            <br><br>
            But it wasn't just gamers that I watched. I also focused on engineers, chemists and doctors, whose videos were themed around informing and entertaining people at the same time.
            <br><br>
            These YouRubers were such as Peter Stripol, Mark Rober, Nile Red, Veritasium, Kevin Talbot, Raz Shifrin, Styropyro, and many more.
            <br><br>
            Ultimately, this all led me to discover certain tech YouTubers, the most prominent being MKBHD, Gamer's Nexus, Austin Evans, and, most importantly, Linus Tech Tips.
            <br><br>
            It was really mostly Linus that gave me my interest in computers. He taught me how to build them and how fun it is to work with them.
            <br><br>
            Eventually, I was coaxed into saving up for and building my own computer. 
            <br><br>
            It turned out amazing, with lots of RGB and enough power to last me for years to come. I built it around late November - early December of 2021, during the height of the GPU crisis.
            <br><br>
            I ended up paying an extra C$800 for the GPU than I would've just a few months later, but I couldn't wait anymore. Click <a href="https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/xMyTDq" target="_blank">here</a> to see my PC's specs.
