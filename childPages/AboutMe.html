            This was fueled by my obsessive watching of YouTubers who played these various games, such as Kwebblekop, Jelly, Slogoman, Ssundee, DanTDM, Mumbo Jumbo, McCreamy and Lazarbeam.

            As you may probably have noticed, these were primarily Minecraft and Fortnite YouTubers (yes, I was that type of kid)
        </h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>
            But it wasn't just gamers that I watched. I also focused on engineers, chemists and doctors, whose videos were themed around informing and entertaining people at the same time.
        </h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>
            These YouRubers were such as Peter Stripol, Mark Rober, Nile Red, Veritasium, Kevin Talbot, Raz Shifrin, Styropyro, and many more.
        </h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>
            Ultimately, this all led me to discover certain tech YouTubers, the most prominent being MKBHD, Gamer's Nexus, Austin Evans, and, most importantly, Linus Tech Tips.
        </h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>
            It was really mostly Linus that gave me my interest in computers. He taught me how to build them and how fun it is to work with them.
        </h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>
            Eventually, I was coaxed into saving up for and building my own computer. 
        </h1>
        <br><br>

            It turned out amazing, with lots of RGB and enough power to last me for years to come. I built it around late November - early December of 2021, during the height of the GPU crisis.
        </h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>
            I ended up paying an extra C$800 for the GPU than I would've just a few months later, but I couldn't wait anymore.

            Fast forward to June of that same year, M.E. Lazerte rejected me because they were too full and it wasn't my designated school. So, I went and applied to Queen Elizabeth and they took me immediately.
        </h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>
            As you may have guessed, I took the computer science course there in grade 10, and one of our assignments was to make a website promoting something. So, I chose to promote my classmates' promotional websites and, later, their games, too.
        </h1>
        <br><br>
        <h1>
            That's all there is to it. I watched people play games, then got into computers in the same way, didn't go to a certain high school, and eventually ended up making this site at a different one.
        </h1>

            Thank you for reading up all the way here. I hope you now have a greater sense of appreciation for the long journey this website took before coming into fruition!
